# Expense Tracker

Expense Tracker is a web application that allows users to track their personal expenses. Each user can log in to their account and view, add, edit, and delete their own transactions. The application provides various features to help manage personal finances, such as categorizing expenses and displaying them in charts.

## Features

- **Multi-user Support**: Each user can log in and only view their own transactions.
- **Image Handling**: Ability to add images (stored in the database as byte[]) to transactions and display them.
- **Front-end Technologies**: The website is built using Bootstrap, CSS, and Syncfusion components.
- **Expense CRUD**: Users can create, read, update, and delete both expense categories and individual expenses.
- **Charts and Navigation**: Expenses are displayed using charts for better visualization, and a navbar helps with easy navigation.
- **User Sessions**: User identification is managed through sessions, allowing for secure and personalized experiences.

## Technologies Used

- **EntityFramework**: Used for database operations.
- **Syncfusion**: Used for front-end components, licensed for use in this project.
